# shard_discord_bot

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lxvongobsthndlE/shard_discord_bot/master/Crystal_Shard.png" alt="Shard Dicord Bot Logo" width="200"/>

A Discord bot written in Node.js using [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).

**This bot is still under active development!**

> If you are still interested in adding it to your server use to following link: [Shard Invite](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=759925230017052674&scope=bot&permissions=1577057495 "Invite Shard Bot to your Discord Server")
>> (Since there currently is no way of adding admins to the bot, you'll have to contact me @lxvongobsthndl#0420 on Discord to do it manually for you.)
